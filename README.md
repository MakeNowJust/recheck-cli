# ‚å®Ô∏è Recheck CLI

The [MakeNowJust-Labo/recheck](https://github.com/MakeNowJust-Labo/recheck) ReDoc checker in CLI form.

Just pass a path glob and let it do the checking!

## üìë Summary

This is a little CLI used to find Regex Denial-of-Service ([ReDos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS))) problems in your code. This can happen when a regular expression is built in a way where the time it takes to run it grows exponentially when certain input strings are used, causing the aforementioned denial-of-service.

Here we scan use the [ReCheck](https://github.com/MakeNowJust-Labo/recheck) javascript ReDos scanner to go over your glob pattern of files to test them for vulnerable RegEx patterns.

## üñ®Ô∏è Usage

In general, you just pass a path glob as the first argument, and it will scan all matching files for regexes and subsequently run those regexes through the redos checker, printing all matching vulnerable regexes at the end.

We have statically linked binaries for MacOS, Windows and Linux available in the `Releases` here on Github, just download them and run them on the commandline like so:

```bash
./recheck-cli-linux "src/**/*.js"
```

This package is also published on npm, so you can run it with `npx` without having to manually install it first.

```bash
npx recheck-cli "**/*.js"
```

You can include the `node_modules` directories (ignored by default) by passing the `-n` flag before the glob pattern.

Example Output:

```
$ /opt/ndomino/recheck-cli/cli.js 'functions/**/*.js'

recheck results:
